      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this is the typical post people write in December or in January. But for me, it has more sense to do it now, not only because everybody is hoping to come back to some &amp;ldquo;kind of&amp;rdquo; normality (ending the summer, new school-year&amp;hellip;) but also exactly one year ago I was starting a new adventure in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I start over with a personal blog after years of silence. I guess never is late for doing it. I have said &lt;em&gt;start over&lt;/em&gt; because I had a blog in the past, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
