      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m √Ålex, a Software Engineer from Spain.
Nowdays I work helping to find new treatments for rare diseases at Healx an AI-driven company based in Cambridge. Previously, I worked in Taiga.io, I founded Initios, a software company, and co-founded Parkapp among other things.
I had a wide experience in I.T projects and I&amp;rsquo;m also a computer security enthusiast. I like to work as team facilitator and I think that the most valuable thing for achieving the goals is communication.</description>
